Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

Paradise Nursery is a React-based shopping cart application for an online plant store. The app allows users to browse plants by category, view plant details, add items to a shopping cart, and manage quantities dynamically.

This project was developed as the Final Project to apply React and Redux concepts learned throughout the course.
